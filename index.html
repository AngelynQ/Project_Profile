												<h3 class="proj"> ADDITIONAL FEATURE ON CYBER SECURITY FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE </h3>
												<img src="images/sc6.png" alt="" class="img6"/>
												<p class="pho1">Photo from: (L. Swissa, 2017)https://medium.com/@liorswissa/hacking-cars-cyber-security-for-autonomous-vehicles-are-we-there-yet-d43ac350de41</p>
												<h4 class="interest">Additional security notification for self driving vehicles: </h4>
												<ul class="interest">
													<li>Warning notification for hacking attempt</li>
													<li>SOS voice/message notification to registered emergency numbers</li>
													<li>Automatic history saved for a hacking attempt or incident</li>
												</ul>
												<p class="interest">Function as a built in security notification feature for self driving cars.This feature is an Automatic alarm built in application software installed in self-driving or autonomous vehicle for security threat detection or hacking attempt. The vehicle system will popped up emergency alert to switch for manual driver’s mode so the vehicle can automatically shutdown electronic or car’s computer system and blocked hackers from overriding the car. It detects malicious activity outside the protected or unique encrypted data for every autonomous cars. It also send’s an alarm message, voice notification and automatic location address of the vehicle and the vehicle owner’s information to registered emergency numbers for extra security features in the case of Hijack and Auto saved history file for the hacking attempt or incident.</p>
												<p class="interest">Autonomous vehicles are gaining increased attention as a road safety, convenience and smart transport solution. Autonomous car safety is one of the biggest concerns that need to be addressed prior to widespread rolling out of the technology, given the potentially catastrophic consequences of a successful hacking operation. If successful hackers could engage in destructive behaviour, malicious denial of service or kidnaping if any occupants. The possibility of reckless owner behaviours also needs to be considered- e.g. dangerous modifications.</p>
												<p class="interest">Hence cybersecurity is a crucial ingredient in ensuring successful consumer penetration and regulatory approval of self-driving cars. Given the rapid progression of cyber crime companies and governments have struggled to hire enough qualified professionals to safe -guard against the growing threat and the car industry will therefore need to aggressively recruit suitably qualified individuals.</p>
												<p class="interest">Although there are various level for autonomous cars (https://www.truecar.com/blog/5-levels-autonomous-vehicles/ , March 5, 2018) from level 1- Driver Assistance, level 2-Partial Automation, level 3-Conditional Automation, Level 4- high Automation and level 5-Full automation. Means the higher level of automation the higher risk to be more susceptible from cyber attacks as it function as driverless car and mostly computer operated. Although Autonomous cars claimed to eliminate major accidents from human error. The biggest challenge is the safety against hackers.</p>
												<p class="interest">It is useful to initially define the scope of the threat landscape. Cyberattacks for autonomous cars might involve any of the following methodologies: use of phishing, ‘man- in -the -middle’ attacks, Trojan horses, spyware and adware, computer viruses/worms. Threats may originate externally from malicious unknown parties, or internally from the legitimate user.</p><br>
												<p class="interest">A. External:</p>
												<ul class="lst">
													
														<li>Accessing user’s personal information</li>
														<li>Take control of the car. Denial of service, theft, terrorism, kidnapping.</li>	
												</ul>
												<p class="interest">B. Internal: Illegal modification to the vehicles normal operations, not being of malicious intent but nevertheless potentially hazardous.</p>
												<p class="interest">The built in notification security feature has a strong encrypted data and  on the vehicle’s computer system.</p>
												
												<p class="interest">So what is encryption? It is a converted digital data into another form known as cipher-text. It transform information on a computer in a way it becomes unreadable. It hides actual data or information unless it will be decrypted.</p>
												<p class="interest">It will be applied in Autonomous vehicles in different connectivity areas: </p>
												<ol class="lst">
													
														<li>Driver Authentication</li>
														<li>Cryptographically securing vehicle to infrastructure communication</li>
														<li>Cryptographically securing vehicle to vehicle communication.</li>
												</ol>
												<p class="pho1">(http://futurex.com, Self Driving Cars Need Encryption, 2017) </p>
												<p class="interest">The  security ideally aims to prevent hacker penetration by giving the vehicle user enough warning. Users could then  input an emergency number into the vehicle’s computer interface and save it with a modern encryption algorithm. It is programmed in software system of the vehicle and embedded to a microchip (Hardware system of the car) together by data encryption of the vehicle that once triggered by a hacking attempt, will immediately send a signal mechanism to quarantine the threat and send a warning recommendation  for the driver to switch back to manual control mode. After performing this safety precaution, the vehicle will automatically shut-down the software and hardware system to blocked the attack. The shut-down feature will be mostly useful in instances of hijack and could automatically send a vehicle’s information and SOS voice or message notification to the registered emergency numbers via satellite  or GPS. In the case of fully autonomous cars, the precautionary method will be similar except the  shutdown feature could not be triggered straight away as it needs to slow down and auto-park in a safe location. The hacking attempt will then be recorded to the cars computer system for investigation to prevent hackers from attacking the same encrypted data, and for investigation by authorities.</p>
												<p class="interest">So how is encrypted data stored inside the car?  (https://www.tuxera.com/blog/file-system-encryption-ensures-data-security-in-connected-cars/) It starts on the File system that manages data that goes to various devices inside connected cars. Encryption is added to the file system to keep data secured and only allows authorised parties to have key access. This is called File System Encryption. It can run through software, hardware or a combination of both. Although, according to (https://www.ontrack.com/uk/blog/making-data-simple/hardware-encryption-vs-software-encryption-the-simple-guide/ 2017). Hardware encryption is safer than software encryption because it is seperate from the rest of the machine. Although they have both and Pros and Cons, this project recommendation would be running on both methods , although typically with a high percentage of a hardware installation for the encrypted data as it possesses a higher safety threshold. </p>
												<p class="interest">Fully autonomous cars should have more complex and advanced encryption, as it is more vulnerable to hacking and lack the option of human driver intervention.</p>
												
											<h4 class="interest">Tools and Technologies:</h4>
												<p class="interest">Technically, to install the extra features, (warning notification for hacking attempt and Auto send SOS voice/message to emergency numbers for Autonomous vehicle, is to create a software that has a programmed functionality for the automatic warning notification. It will then be embedded to the hardware system of the car or in a microchip. The negative part about using hardware system is it only have a limited storage for programmed so a combined application n the car system( software and hardware) will be ideal. microchip provides a comprehensive approach to automotive security. MicrochipTechnology has developed KIT for Tier 1 auto suppliers that is design to make commercial vehicles from hacking.(Rob Spiegel in Automation and Motion Control, Cyber Security, 2019).</p>
												<p class="pho1">https://www.designnews.com/automation-motion-control/microchip-technology-creates-automotive-cybersecurity-kit/148143405661837 </p>
												<p class="interest">There are various software and hardware file systems that most car manufacturers use depending on their standards. It requires file system to be programmed on a computer before the installation. C++ is commonly used for autonomous vehicle. (J. Marks 2018) (.https://medium.com/@olley_io/what-software-do-autonomous-vehicle-engineers-use-part-1-2-275631071199). File system will be encoded with modern encrypted data for security. So how is data inside cars handled and stored? It is like your computer that organise data into files so it will be easy to find stored data using certain applications.(T. Rossi, File system encryption ensures data security in connected cars)</p>
												<p class="pho1">https://www.tuxera.com/blog/file-system-encryption-ensures-data-security-in-connected-cars/.  </p>
												<p class="interest">To summarise this project, data encryption is not new in the autonomous car industry and continues to expand It’s safety features as there will be always a threat for security. Autonomous drive vehicles, particularly driver-less cars ,carry inherent increased risk and threats include hijack, terrorism and theft. Hence, autonomous car manufacturers are doing their best to keep a higher standard of safety for these consumers. As more people demand comfort, we are also more vulnerable by a hacking attack as more cars are relying now on computers.   The additional features highlighted including auto-notification of driver (manual over-ride) and Police (hijack/public safety threat), quarantine of hack and auto-park are an innovation ,as it prevents hackers from creating chaos which may also lead to mass casualties. Usability must be balanced with public safety, to strike a balance encouraging mass-adoption with satisfying regulatory public safety concerns. </p>
